## Security

Depending on the type of security issue and the component affected, there are two different report procedures:
* [Security vulnerability or issue on a software component](#Security-vulnerability-or-issue-on-a-software-component)
* [Security issue on a package hosted by the registry](#Security-issue-on-a-package-hosted-by-the-registry)

If you have a doubt, follow the first procedure: [Security vulnerability or issue on a software component](#Security-vulnerability-or-issue-on-a-software-component)
