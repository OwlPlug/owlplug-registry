It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound. However, it was not designed as a self-contained completely independent soft-synth. It needs to be contained within a VST framework where things like transposition, automation, layering, arpeggiation, etc., are available. Also, like many synths of the OB-X's generation, the OB-Xd has no internal effects so its sounds and textures can be greatly enhanced by the use of additional processing like chorus, reverb, delay, etc.","pageUrl":"https://obxd.wordpress.com/","donateUrl":"https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/","version":"0.1.4.1","type":"instrument","tags":["Synth","Analog"],"bundles":[{"name":"Win32 VST","targets":["win32"],"format":"vst","downloadUrl":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/obxd/bundles/obxd-vst-win32.zip","downloadSha256":"51a161d7996d70ca179f80855d755aad95b3968ab7ee3a9476f605664f46856e","fileSize":1965000},{"name":"Win64 VST","targets":["win64"],"format":"vst","downloadUrl":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/obxd/bundles/obxd-vst-win64.zip","downloadSha256":"64d9c4ce2304fc0abf7bc3cce2812718522ef68d664c7c0bb18ad46e434aae6d","fileSize":2229000}]},{"name":"Wobbleizer","slug":"dropsnorz/wobbleizer","creator":"Dropsnorz","license":"mit","screenshotUrl":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/com.dropsnorz.wobbleizer/wobbleizer.png","description":"A frequency filter with LFO modulation","pageUrl":"https://github.com/dropsnorz/wobbleizer","version":"2.3.0.2","technicalUid":"2003788408","type":"effect","stage":"beta","tags":["Filter","LFO"],"bundles":[{"name":"Wobx Win32/64","targets":["win32","win64"],"format":"vst","downloadUrl":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/com.dropsnorz.wobbleizer/bundles/wobbleizer-vst-win32win64.zip","downloadSha256":"35f9446c4494e055938ebe46df60af5162949936416816582cc738a809ab5ccd","fileSize":2858000},{"name":"Wobx Osx","targets":["osx"],"format":"vst","downloadUrl":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/com.dropsnorz.wobbleizer/bundles/wobbleizer-vst-osx.zip","downloadSha256":"17b98b8eda7271f16ec82571bed34ab45192621c98fcada217cde7c54bddb793","fileSize":3169000}]},{"name":"Squeezer","creator":"Martin Zuther","license":"gpl-3.0","screenshotUrl":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/squeezer/squeezer.png","description":"Flexible general-purpose audio compressor with a touch of citrus.\n\nSqueezer is different from all the compressors I know: its knobs are stepped to fine-tuned preset values, but can be changed to continuous values by clicking a small orange light located next to them.
