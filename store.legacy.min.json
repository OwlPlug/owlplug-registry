It attempts to recreate its sound and behavior, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design.\nThe OB-Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound. However, it was not designed as a self-contained completely independent soft-synth. It needs to be contained within a VST framework where things like transposition, automation, layering, arpeggiation, etc., are available. Also, like many synths of the OB-X's generation, the OB-Xd has no internal effects so its sounds and textures can be greatly enhanced by the use of additional processing like chorus, reverb, delay, etc.","pageUrl":"https://obxd.wordpress.com/","donateUrl":"https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/","version":"0.1.4.1","type":"instrument","tags":["Synth","Analog"],"bundles":[{"name":"Win32
